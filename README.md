# Cover Type

## Key Feature

* Combining Categorical Columns: The code combines the 'Wilderness_Area' and 'Soil_Type' categorical columns into single columns, simplifying the dataset for modeling.
* Hyperparameter Tuning with RandomSearch: The code employs hyperparameter tuning using RandomSearch to search for the best hyperparameter configuration, particularly the number of layers, units per layer, and learning rate for the neural network model.
* Model Training and Validation: The code trains the neural network model using the best hyperparameters and tracks the best validation accuracy achieved during the training process. It provides insights into model performance and helps in selecting the best model configuration.
