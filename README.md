# Predicting Forest Cover Types with Neural Network

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting forest cover types using neural networks. The goal is to build a predictive model that can classify the cover type of a forest area based on its features using neural networks.

## Key Feature

* Combining Categorical Columns.
* Hyperparameter Tuning with RandomSearch.
* Model Training and Validation.

## Deployment

## File Description
  
* **CoverType_classification.ipynb:** This notebook contains code to build the neural network.
* **cover_data.csv:** This csv file contains data for analysis.
