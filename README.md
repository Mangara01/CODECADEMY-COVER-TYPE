# Forest Cover Type Prediction with Neural Networks

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting forest cover types using neural networks. The goal is to build a predictive model that can classify the cover type of a forest area based on its features using neural networks.

## Key Feature

* Combining Categorical Columns: The code combines the 'Wilderness_Area' and 'Soil_Type' categorical columns into single columns, simplifying the dataset for modeling.
* Hyperparameter Tuning with RandomSearch: The code employs hyperparameter tuning using RandomSearch to search for the best hyperparameter configuration.
* Model Training and Validation: The code trains the neural network model using the best hyperparameters and tracks the best validation accuracy achieved during the training process.
